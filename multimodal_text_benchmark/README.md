# Datasets in the Benchmark

Here is how to load a particular dataset into a pandas DataFrame. The following code loads the `prod` (i.e. product_sentiment_machine_hack) dataset:

```python
from auto_mm_bench.datasets import dataset_registry

print(dataset_registry.list_keys())  # use these keys to specify which dataset to load

train_dataset = dataset_registry.create('product_sentiment_machine_hack', 'train')
test_dataset = dataset_registry.create('product_sentiment_machine_hack', 'test')
print(train_dataset.data)
```

These commands will also download a local copy of the dataset file, which is either in Parquet or CSV format (both can be easily loaded into pandas DataFrame).
The data files are currently hosted in AWS Simple Cloud Storage (S3), you can find the location of each file in [datasets.py](src/auto_mm_bench/datasets.py). 
For the official benchmark, each dataset is provided with a training/test split, but we leave it up to ML systems how much validation data to set aside from the training data. 

The statistics of the benchmarking datasets are listed in the table below.
